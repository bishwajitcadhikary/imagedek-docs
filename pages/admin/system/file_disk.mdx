# File Disk (Storage) Provider

Here you can set the location of the file storage. The default is the `local` disk in the root of the application. You can change this to any location you want. The only requirement is that the folder must be writable by the application.

## Supported Drivers
The following storage drivers are supported:
  * `local`
  * `s3`
  * `dropbox`
  * `digitalocean`

### List of File Disks
In the `File Disk` section, you will see a list of all configured storage disks. Each disk will display its name, type, and status.

### Create a File Disk
To create a new file disk, click on the `Add Disk` button. Provide the required details, such as the disk name, driver type, and configuration settings (e.g., access keys for S3). Save the changes to add the new disk.
