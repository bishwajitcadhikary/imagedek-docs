# File/Folder Permissions

If you are using a Linux server, you will need to make sure that the files and folders are set to the correct permissions. The following is a list of the permissions that you will need to set:

## Directories
```bash copy
# Change to the public_html directory
cd path/to/public_html

# Set the permissions for the directories
chmod -R 775 storage/logs
chmod -R 775 storage/framework
chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache

# If you are using a different user, you can use the following command to set the permissions:
sudo -u YOUR_USER_NAME chmod -R 775 storage/logs
sudo -u YOUR_USER_NAME chmod -R 775 storage/framework
sudo -u YOUR_USER_NAME chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache
```
